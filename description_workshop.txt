[h1]v0.1.0[/h1]
Adds text when hovering over an NPC head in the housing menu which lists their biome and neighbor preferences.
Comes with a configurable key to toggle the display on and off.

Implementation inspired by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2687866031]Census[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857866907]NPC Happiness Viewer[/url]

Works with modded NPCs.

The mod also makes it possible for other mods to query this information and the text descriptions, if it would be helpful.
