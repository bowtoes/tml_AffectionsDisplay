### v0.1.1
Adds text when hovering over an NPC head in the housing menu which lists their biome and neighbor preferences.  
Comes with a configurable key to toggle the display on and off.
The color can also be changed, as well as text scaling.

Works with modded NPCs.

Implementation inspired by [Census](https://github.com/JavidPack/Census) and [NPC Happiness Viewer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2857866907).

Todo: The text can be a little hard to read, may want to make it an actual UI element with a background, but for a first release this will work.
